        <h2 style="box-sizing: border-box;">Information we may collect</h2>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">You can leave feedback on some pages of the website or on a user survey. You can choose to share your email address if you want a reply. Otherwise, we collect and store feedback anonymously</p>
        <h3 style="box-sizing: border-box;">Cookies</h3>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">Our website uses cookies. These are small files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website. They store information about how you use the website, such as the pages you visit.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">The law says that we can store cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary to make our website work. For all other types of cookies we need your permission before we can use them on your device.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">We like to use analytics cookies which measure how you use our website and help us improve our service for future users but we only use these cookies if you say it's OK.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;"><a href="/cookie-policy" style="box-sizing: border-box;">Read our cookie policy</a> to find out more about the cookies we use and tell us if we can put analytics cookies on your device.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">We sometimes use tools on other organisations' websites to collect data or to ask for feedback. These tools set their own cookies. </p>
        <h4 style="box-sizing: border-box;">How we collect and store your data</h4>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">We will process and store your data in accordance with the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the platform in question. You should be aware that your use of these platforms is governed by the terms and conditions agreed between you and the platform, rather than with us.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">We will not remove, duplicate or transfer your personal data from or between any of the social platforms that we use, except for when you give us explicit permission to do so or when we believe that we need to in order to respond to an urgent risk to health.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">For example, if you interact with us in a way that raises serious concerns about your mental health, we may share your personal details with local NHS services to make sure that you are offered appropriate support.</p>
        <h2 style="box-sizing: border-box;">Keeping your personal data secure</h2>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">We convert your data into secure code (encrypt it) and store it on secure servers in England. A partner organisation is providing hosting services but has no say in how the information is used. There are no legal ways for their employees to see the data. Only approved people in our service can see it.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you shared your email with us as part of a survey, we will delete it after 2 years. At that point no one can identify you in the survey data.</p>
        <h2 style="box-sizing: border-box;">Data sharing</h2>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">We may share anonymous information on how the service is used with the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), and the National Clinical Governance Group.</p>
        <h3 style="box-sizing: border-box;">Legal powers</h3>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">When you give us personal information, we may pass it on if the law says we must.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you make a claim against us, we and other third parties such as our solicitors may need to look at this information.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">We will not share your personal information with anyone else without your permission for any other reason.</p>
        <h2 style="box-sizing: border-box;">Your rights</h2>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">You can:</p>
        <ul style="box-sizing: border-box;">
