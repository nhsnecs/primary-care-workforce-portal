        Cookies
    </legend>
    <p>
        When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
    </p>
    <p>
        These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task
        Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested
        Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
        You can manage these small files yourself through your browser setting.
    </p>
    <p>
        We like to use analytics cookies which measure how you use our website and help us improve our service for future users but we only use these cookies if you say it's OK.
        Read our <a href='/cookie-policy/'>cookie policy</a> to find out more about the cookies we use and tell us if we can put analytics cookies on your device.
        We sometimes use tools on other organisations' websites to collect data or to ask for feedback. These tools set their own cookies.
