<ul>
  <li>PCNs claiming workforce payments under the Network Contract Directed Enhanced Service (DES) in 2020/21; and</li>
  <li>Commissioners (CCGs/STPs/ICSs) reviewing and approving the claims</li>
</ul>
<p>PCN reimbursement claims must only be for staff additional to the 2019-20 PCN baseline. Where a baseline has not been established, reimbursement claims are still to be for new additional staff recruited during 2019-20 onwards</p>
<ul>
  <li>As part of local due diligence, PCNs may be required by commissioners to demonstrate that claims being made are for new additional staff roles beyond this baseline</li>
  <li>Claims are only applicable following the start of employment and to cover the period of employment (i.e. whilst the individual is in post), providing the employee is not in the baseline as at 31 March 2019</li>
  <li>Once all claims have been approved, the commissioner must keep a record of each approved claim for audit purposes</li>
