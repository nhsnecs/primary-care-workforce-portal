  As part of the New to Partnership Payment Scheme you are required to complete an annual reconciliation process. You must complete all sections of this form in relation to your past year on the scheme. The information you provide will be utilised to ascertain whether any amendments are necessary in relation to your sum received, or ongoing participation in the scheme. Please note a variation in your agreed sessions may result in a repayment in part or ‘top-up’ of your grant sum.
</p>
<p>
  If you have recently completed a change form to update the information we hold on record for you, you are still required to complete this annual reconciliation.
</p>
<p>
  You will be required to submit the annual reconciliation information within two weeks post your partnership anniversary. Once you have completed all of the sections and clicked submit, your practice will be notified via the portal to confirm that the information provided correlates with information held by the practice.
