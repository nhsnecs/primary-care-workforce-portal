<p style="box-sizing: border-box;">The New to Partnership Payment scheme is a commitment made in the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/gp/the-best-place-to-work/new-to-partnership-payment-scheme/" target="_blank" style="box-sizing: border-box;"> Update to the GP Contract 2023/24</a> document. It is a nationally managed scheme aimed at supporting registered health care professionals to become practice partners (or equivalent) through creating a learning fund to develop skills, coupled with a financial payment. The overarching aim is to grow the number of partners and individuals with equivalent status working in primary care, stabilising the partnership model and helping to increase cliniciansâ€™ participation levels so that primary care and the patients it serves have access to the workforce they need.</p>
